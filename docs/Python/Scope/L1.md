## Scope of Variables in Python (SV1)

1. **What is the scope of a variable in Python?**
   - The scope of a variable in Python defines where in your code a particular variable can be accessed or modified. Python has different levels of variable scope, including global and local scopes.

2. **Global scope:**
   - Variables defined outside of any function or block have global scope. They can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the code.
     ```python
     global_variable = 10  # This is a global variable
     ```

3. **Local scope:**
   - Variables defined inside a function have local scope. They are only accessible within that specific function.
     ```python
     def my_function():
         local_variable = 20  # This is a local variable within 'my_function'
     ```

4. **Accessing variables:**
   - To access a global variable from within a function, you can use the `global` keyword. Otherwise, Python will treat it as a local variable within the function.
     ```python
     global_variable = 10

     def my_function():
         global global_variable  # Use 'global' to access the global variable
         print(global_variable)
     ```

5. **Modifying variables:**
   - If you want to modify a global variable from within a function, you need to use the `global` keyword to indicate that you're working with the global variable and not creating a new local one.
     ```python
     global_variable = 10

     def modify_global_variable():
         global global_variable
         global_variable += 1  # Modifies the global variable
     ```

6. **Shadowing:**
   - When a local variable in a function has the same name as a global variable, it "shadows" the global variable within the function's scope. The local variable takes precedence.
     ```python
     x = 10

     def my_function():
         x = 20  # This 'x' shadows the global 'x' within the function
     ```

7. **LEGB rule:**
   - Python follows the LEGB (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) rule to determine the scope of a variable. It checks for the variable's presence in each of these scopes in the mentioned order.

8. **Enclosing scope (Closure):**
   - In nested functions, variables from the outer (enclosing) function are accessible in the inner function, creating a closure.
     ```python
     def outer_function():
         x = 10

         def inner_function():
             print(x)  # 'x' from the outer function is accessible here
     ```

9. **Built-in scope:**
   - Python has a built-in scope that includes functions like `print()` and `len()`. These functions are available globally without the need to declare them.

10. **Using nonlocal keyword:**
    - In nested functions, if you want to modify a variable from an outer (enclosing) function without making it global, you can use the `nonlocal` keyword.
      ```python
      def outer_function():
          x = 10

          def inner_function():
              nonlocal x
              x += 1  # Modifies 'x' from the outer function
      ```
