## String Formatting in Python (L1)

1. **What is string formatting in Python?**
   - String formatting in Python refers to the process of inserting or substituting variables into a string template. Python offers various ways to format strings including %-formatting, `str.format()`, f-strings, and more.

2. **How to use %-formatting?**
   - The % operator can be used to substitute values into a string using specific format specifiers like `%s` (for strings), `%d` (for integers), etc.:
     ```python
     name = "Alice"
     age = 30
     print("My name is %s and I am %d years old." % (name, age))
     ```

3. **Using `str.format()`:**
   - Introduced in Python 2.6, `str.format()` provides a more advanced way to format strings:
     ```python
     print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))
     ```

4. **How to use f-strings?**
   - Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings (formatted string literals) offer an expressive way to embed expressions within string literals:
     ```python
     print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
     ```

5. **Formatting numbers:**
   - Numbers can be formatted to control the number of decimal places, alignment, and other attributes:
     ```python
     number = 123.45678
     print(f"Formatted number: {number:.2f}")  # Rounds to 2 decimal places
     ```

6. **Using alignment in string formatting:**
   - Strings can be aligned using the alignment options in formatting:
     ```python
     print(f"{name:>10}")  # Right aligns the string within 10 spaces
     ```

7. **Braces in formatted strings:**
   - To include a literal brace (`{` or `}`) in a formatted string, double them up:
     ```python
     print(f"{{ and }} are used in f-strings.")
     ```

8. **Date and time formatting:**
   - Using the `datetime` module, dates and times can be formatted in strings:
     ```python
     import datetime
     today = datetime.date.today()
     print(f"Today's date is {today:%B %d, %Y}")
     ```

9. **Common use cases for string formatting:**
   - String formatting is commonly used to create user-friendly outputs, generate dynamic messages, log data in specific formats, and more.

10. **Escaping characters in strings:**
    - Backslash `\` can be used to escape special characters in a string like `\"` for a double quote or `\\` for a backslash:
      ```python
      print("This is a \"double quote\" and this is a backslash: \\")
      ```
