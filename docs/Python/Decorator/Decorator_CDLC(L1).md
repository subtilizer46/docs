## Introduction: 
In Python, a decorator is a special type of function that is used to modify the behavior of other functions or methods without changing their source code. Decorators are often used to add functionality to functions or methods in a clean and reusable way. 

Here's the basic structure of a decorator:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Code to run before calling the decorated function
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # Code to run after calling the decorated function
        return result
    return wrapper
```

- `my_decorator` is the decorator function.
- `func` is the function being decorated.
- `wrapper` is an inner function that wraps around `func`. It can perform actions before and after calling `func`.

To use a decorator, you typically apply it to a function or method using the `@decorator_name` syntax, like this:

```python
@my_decorator
def my_function():
    # Function code
```

When `my_function` is called, it will actually invoke `wrapper`, which can add functionality before and after executing the original `my_function`.

Common use cases for decorators include logging, authentication, authorization, memoization, and more. Decorators enhance code readability, reusability, and maintainability by separating cross-cutting concerns from the core logic of functions or methods.
