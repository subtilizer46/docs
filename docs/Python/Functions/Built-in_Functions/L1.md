## Built-in Functions in Python (BF1)

1. **What are built-in functions in Python?**
   - Built-in functions in Python are pre-defined functions that are included in the Python language and can be used without the need for additional declarations. They perform common tasks and operations.

2. **How do you use a built-in function?**
   - You can use a built-in function by calling its name followed by parentheses, passing any required arguments inside the parentheses.
     ```python
     result = len([1, 2, 3])  # Calls the 'len' function to get the length of a list
     ```

3. **Common built-in functions:**
   - **`len()`:** Returns the length of a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or string).
   - **`print()`:** Displays output to the console.
   - **`input()`:** Reads user input from the console.
   - **`str()`, `int()`, `float()`:** Convert values to strings, integers, or floating-point numbers.
   - **`type()`:** Returns the data type of an object.
   - **`max()`, `min()`:** Returns the maximum or minimum value from a sequence.
   - **`sum()`:** Returns the sum of all elements in an iterable.
   - **`list()`, `tuple()`, `set()`, `dict()`:** Create lists, tuples, sets, or dictionaries.
   - **`range()`:** Generates a sequence of numbers.
   - **`abs()`:** Returns the absolute value of a number.
   - **`sorted()`:** Returns a sorted version of an iterable.

4. **User-defined functions vs. built-in functions:**
   - User-defined functions are functions you create yourself using the `def` keyword, tailored to your specific needs.
   - Built-in functions are ready-made functions provided by Python for common tasks.

5. **Importing additional functions:**
   - You can access additional functions by importing modules or libraries, extending the functionality of Python. For example, the `math` module provides mathematical functions like `sqrt()` and `sin()`.

6. **Custom functions:**
   - While built-in functions cover many common tasks, you can create custom functions using the `def` keyword to perform specific operations unique to your program.

7. **Using built-in functions efficiently:**
   - Utilizing built-in functions is efficient and recommended, as they are optimized for performance and reliability. Always check the Python documentation for details on each function's usage.
