**What is a Cluster?**
* Imagine you have a big box of assorted candies: gummies, chocolates, and hard candies. 
* If you sort them into separate bowls based on their types, each bowl now contains candies that are more similar to each other than to candies in the other bowls. 
* Each of these bowls is like a "cluster" in the world of data â€“ a group where members are more similar to each other than to those outside the group.

**Example:**
Let's say you have a list of numbers: [2, 3, 4, 25, 27, 29]. If you want to group them into two clusters:

1. You might randomly pick initial centers, say 4 and 27.
2. Assign each number to the nearest center. So, [2, 3, 4] are closer to 4 and [25, 27, 29] are closer to 27.
3. Calculate the average of [2, 3, 4], which is 3, and the average of [25, 27, 29], which is 27.
4. Now, 3 and 27 are your new centers.
5. Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centers don't change anymore. In this case, they already don't, so you're done!
