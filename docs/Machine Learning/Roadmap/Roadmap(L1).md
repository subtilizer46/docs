# Roadmap For Freshers

1. **Foundations**:
   - **Mathematics**: (You can brushup from class 11th and 12th notebook)
     - **Linear Algebra**: Understand matrices, vectors, dot products.
     - **Probability**: Basic probability rules, Bayes' theorem.
     - **Statistics**: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation.
   - **Programming**:
     - **Python**: Basic syntax, list comprehensions, functions, and libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`.

2. **Basic Machine Learning Concepts**:
   - **Types of ML**: Difference between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
   - **Overfitting & Underfitting**: Understanding bias-variance trade-off.
   - **Train-Test Split**: Why it's essential and how to do it.
   - **Cross-Validation**: What it is and why it's used.
   - **Loss Functions**: Mean Squared Error, Log Loss, etc.

3. **Basic Algorithms**:
   - Understand the intuition and basic working of:
     - **Linear Regression**.
     - **Logistic Regression**.
     - **Decision Trees**.
     - **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Classification**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.
   - **Regression**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared.

5. **Regularization**:
   - Basic understanding of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization.

6. **Tools**:
   - **Scikit-learn**: Familiarize yourself with this library as it's commonly used for basic ML tasks. Understand how to train and evaluate models using it.
   - **Jupyter Notebook**: Know how to use it for writing and presenting Python code.

7. **Soft Skills & Problem Solving**:
   - **Communication**: Be ready to explain complex topics simply.
   - **Problem Solving**: You may be given a hypothetical problem and asked how you'd approach it from an ML perspective.
   - **Behavioral Questions**: Why do you want to work here? Tell me about a project you've worked on.

8. **Tips**:
   - **Hands-On Practice**: Work on small projects or Kaggle beginner challenges to solidify your understanding.
   - **Mock Interviews**: Practice with friends or use platforms like Pramp.
   - **Stay Updated**: Entry-level interviews may focus on basics, but being aware of current trends can be a plus.
   - **Understand the Company**: Know what the company does and how machine learning fits into their goals.

9. **Resources for Preparation**:
   - **Books**: "Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka, "The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book" by Andriy Burkov.
   - **Interview-specific**: "Cracking the Machine Learning Interview" by Jake VanderPlas.

10. **Questions to Expect**:
   - Conceptual questions about the algorithms and techniques you've learned.
   - Possible code-based questions to test your Python and data manipulation skills.
   - Scenario-based questions: "Given data X, how would you approach problem Y?"
   - Questions about past projects or experiences: "Describe a challenge you faced in a past project and how you overcame it."
