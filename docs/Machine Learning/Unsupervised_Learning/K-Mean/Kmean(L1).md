## K-means algorithm with the given employee data using the `sklearn` library:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data: [hours worked per day, emails sent, meetings per week, break length, days WFH per month]
data = [
    [9, 100, 5, 10, 1],
    [7, 50, 3, 15, 2],
    [6, 20, 1, 20, 8],
    [10, 110, 6, 5, 0],
    [8, 60, 4, 10, 3],
    # ... add more sample data as needed
]

data = np.array(data)

# Apply K-means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)  # 3 clusters as in the example
kmeans.fit(data)
labels = kmeans.labels_

# Print out the labels (clusters) for each data point
for i, label in enumerate(labels):
    print(f"Employee {i+1} belongs to cluster {label+1}")

# For visualization purposes, let's plot based on two features: hours worked per day and days WFH per month
plt.scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 4], c=labels, cmap='rainbow')
plt.xlabel('Hours Worked per Day')
plt.ylabel('Days Work From Home per Month')
plt.title('K-means Clustering of Employees')
plt.show()
```

This code will segment the employees into 3 clusters based on the provided sample data. For a more detailed analysis and better visualization, you'd likely want to consider more advanced techniques and perhaps a higher-dimensional visualization tool.

Ensure you have `sklearn` and `matplotlib` libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib
```
