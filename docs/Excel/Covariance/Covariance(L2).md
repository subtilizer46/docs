### Covariance and Correlation: Differences

1. **What They Measure:**
   - **Covariance:** Measures whether two variables change together (either increase or decrease at the same time).
   - **Correlation:** Measures both how strongly two variables are related and whether they change together.

2. **Value Ranges:**
   - **Covariance:** Can take any value between negative infinity and positive infinity.
   - **Correlation:** Ranges from -1 to 1.

3. **Interpretation:**
   - **Covariance:**
     - Positive covariance: When one variable increases, the other also increases.
     - Negative covariance: When one variable increases, the other decreases.
     - But, you can’t tell how strong the relationship is just by looking at the covariance value.
   - **Correlation:**
     - +1: Perfect positive correlation (if one variable goes up, the other goes up).
     - 0: No correlation (the variables don’t seem to go up or down together).
     - -1: Perfect negative correlation (if one variable goes up, the other goes down).
     - The closer the correlation is to +1 or -1, the stronger the relationship.

4. **Units:**
   - **Covariance:** Is expressed in units obtained by multiplying the units of the two variables.
   - **Correlation:** Is unit-less because it’s a standardized measure.

5. **Graphical Representation:**
   - **Covariance:** No specific graphical representation to reflect positive or negative covariance clearly.
   - **Correlation:** Can be visually represented and is clear - a line going upwards indicates positive correlation and going downwards indicates negative correlation.
