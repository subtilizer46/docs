## Pivot Chart

### Task 1: **Sales Trend Analysis**
Analyze the sales trend for each fruit over the provided dates. Are there any notable peaks or troughs? What might account for these variations?

### Task 2: **Top Performer**
Identify the fruit with the highest cumulative sales over the given period. Can you pinpoint the date when this fruit had the highest sales?

### Task 3: **Sales Comparison**
Compare the sales of Apple and Banana on 2023-10-01. Which fruit had better sales on that specific date?

### Task 4: **Data Filtering**
Using the filter options in the PivotChart, isolate the sales data for Orange. How does its sales on 2023-10-02 compare to the other fruits on the same date?

### Task 5: **Chart Customization**
Customize the appearance of the PivotChart. Change its chart type, apply a different color scheme, or add data labels to enhance readability.

### Task 6: **Sales Projection**
Based on the given data, make a sales projection for each fruit for the next date, 2023-10-04. Use simple linear trends or averages for this projection.

### Task 7: **Data Interpretation**
Interpret the reasons behind the sales fluctuations. Are there external factors (like seasonality, promotions, etc.) that might influence these sales figures?

### Task 8: **Anomaly Detection**
Identify if there are any anomalies in the sales data. For instance, was there a date when a typically best-selling fruit had an unusual dip in sales?

### Task 9: **Interactive Exploration**
Using slicers or timeline tools, create an interactive dashboard where one can filter and view sales based on specific criteria like a particular fruit or date range.

### Task 10: **Data Expansion**
Imagine and add sales data for two more fruits for the given dates. Then, update the PivotChart to incorporate this new data and analyze the extended dataset's trends and patterns.
