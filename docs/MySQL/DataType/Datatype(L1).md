* MySQL supports several data types to store and manage different types of data. These data types can be categorized into the following groups:


## For Experience Programmer
1. Numeric Data Types:
   - `TINYINT`: A very small integer.
   - `SMALLINT`: A small integer.
   - `MEDIUMINT`: A medium-sized integer.
   - `INT` or `INTEGER`: A standard integer.
   - `BIGINT`: A large integer.
   - `FLOAT`: A floating-point number.
   - `DOUBLE`: A double-precision floating-point number.
   - `DECIMAL` or `NUMERIC`: A fixed-point decimal number.

2. Date and Time Data Types:
   - `DATE`: A date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
   - `TIME`: A time in 'HH:MM:SS' format.
   - `DATETIME`: A combination of date and time.
   - `TIMESTAMP`: A timestamp for when a row was last modified.
   - `YEAR`: A four-digit year.

3. String Data Types:
   - `CHAR`: Fixed-length character string.
   - `VARCHAR`: Variable-length character string.
   - `TINYTEXT`: A tiny, variable-length text string.
   - `TEXT`: A variable-length text string.
   - `MEDIUMTEXT`: A medium-sized, variable-length text string.
   - `LONGTEXT`: A long, variable-length text string.
   - `BINARY`: Fixed-length binary data.
   - `VARBINARY`: Variable-length binary data.
   - `TINYBLOB`: A tiny, variable-length binary large object.
   - `BLOB`: A variable-length binary large object.
   - `MEDIUMBLOB`: A medium-sized, variable-length binary large object.
   - `LONGBLOB`: A long, variable-length binary large object.
   - `ENUM`: A enumeration of possible values.
   - `SET`: A set of possible values.

4. Bit-Value Data Types:
   - `BIT`: A bit-field type.

5. Spatial Data Types:
   - `GEOMETRY`: Spatial data type for storing geometric objects.
   - `POINT`: A single point in a spatial data type.
   - `LINESTRING`: A series of connected points.
   - `POLYGON`: A closed, two-dimensional shape.
   - `MULTIPOINT`: A collection of points.
   - `MULTILINESTRING`: A collection of linestrings.
   - `MULTIPOLYGON`: A collection of polygons.
   - `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`: A collection of various geometric objects.

6. JSON Data Type:
   - `JSON`: Stores JSON-formatted data.


## For beginner

1. **Numeric Data Types**: These are for numbers.
   - `INT` for regular whole numbers.
   - `FLOAT` for numbers with decimal points.
   - `DATE` for dates.
   - `TIME` for times.
   - `DATETIME` for both date and time.
   - `TEXT` for text (like words and sentences).

2. **String Data Types**: These are for storing text.
   - `CHAR` for fixed-length text.
   - `VARCHAR` for variable-length text.
   - `TEXT` for larger pieces of text.
   - `BLOB` for binary data (like images).

3. **Other Types**:
   - `BOOL` or `BOOLEAN` for true/false values.
   - `ENUM` for a predefined list of values.
   - `SET` for a set of possible values.
   - `JSON` for storing JSON data.
