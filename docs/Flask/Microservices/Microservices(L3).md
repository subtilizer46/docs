#### Extending The Idea:

In a real-world scenario, you might have multiple such services, possibly serving different functionalities. For instance, you could have a `user_service` for handling user data, `order_service` for processing orders, etc.

In the world of microservices, these services would communicate with each other, often over HTTP or some message broker (like RabbitMQ or Kafka).

#### Things to Note:

1. **Service Discovery**: In a microservices architecture, services need to discover each other. Tools like Consul, Eureka, or Kubernetes provide service discovery mechanisms.
2. **API Gateway**: It's a common practice to have an API Gateway which acts as a single entry point into your system and routes the request to the appropriate microservice.
3. **Data Consistency**: As services have their databases, maintaining data consistency across services can be challenging. This often involves patterns like Saga.
4. **Monitoring & Logging**: With many services running, monitoring and logging become essential. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, etc., are popular in the microservices world.

**Suggestion**
For beginners, starting with a Flask app as demonstrated above is a good step. As you become more familiar, you can start exploring the above concepts to **build more complex microservices-based applications**.
