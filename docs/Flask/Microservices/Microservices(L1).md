### Microservices: A Brief Introduction

Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement specific business functionalities. The main idea behind microservices is to break down your application into a **set of smaller, interconnected services** instead of building a single, large monolithic application.

**Advantages**:
1. **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled independently.
2. **Maintainability**: Smaller codebases are easier to understand and modify.
3. **Flexibility**: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
4. **Tech Stack Diversity**: Different services can use different technologies.
