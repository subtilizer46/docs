If you want the "Product" link in the navbar to take users to the products page when clicked, you'll need to ensure that the hyperlink for the "Product" item in the navbar points to the correct route (`/product`).

Let's modify the `base.html` file to ensure this:

1️⃣ **Updating Navbar Links in `base.html`**:

Locate the navbar section of your `base.html` (within the `templates` folder). Make sure the `href` attribute for the "Product" link is set to `/product`.

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark">
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">ToyApp</a>
        <div class="collapse navbar-collapse">
            <ul class="navbar-nav mr-auto">
                <li class="nav-item">
                    <a class="nav-link" href="/product">Product</a>
                </li>
                <li class="nav-item">
                    <a class="nav-link" href="/services">Services</a>
                </li>
                <li class="nav-item">
                    <a class="nav-link" href="/contact">Contact</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
</nav>
```

The key part here is:
```html
<a class="nav-link" href="/product">Product</a>
```
This ensures that when you click on the "Product" link in the navbar, you are taken to the products page, where you'll see the listed products.

Now, when you run your Flask app and click on the "Product" link in the navbar, you'll be directed to the product page, displaying the toy products as previously outlined.
