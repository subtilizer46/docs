# Coding questions


1. **Basic Flask Routing**:
   
   Write a Flask application that has three routes:
   - `/`: Displays a "Hello, World!" message.
   - `/about`: Displays an "About Us" message.
   - `/contact`: Displays a "Contact Us" message.

2. **User Input Handling**:

   Create a Flask application that takes a user's name as input through a form and displays a personalized greeting message. The form should be accessible at `/input` and should use the POST method to submit the data to another route.

3. **Database Integration**:

   Build a Flask application that connects to a SQLite database and displays a list of items retrieved from the database on a route `/items`. You should have at least two routes - one for displaying the list and one for adding new items to the database.

4. **Authentication**:

   Develop a simple authentication system using Flask. Create two routes: `/login` and `/dashboard`. Users should be able to log in with a username and password on the `/login` route. After successful login, they should be redirected to the `/dashboard` route, which should display a welcome message with the user's name.
