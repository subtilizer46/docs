* Statelessness in the context of RESTful APIs means that each request from a client to a server should contain all the information needed for the server to understand and fulfill that request. 

* In other words, the server doesn't rely on any previous requests or interactions to process the current request.

* Statelessness in RESTful APIs means that every time you ask a server for something, you have to provide all the details needed for that request. It's like ordering food at a restaurant:

*  You don't have to remind the waiter about your previous orders or likes. Each time you order, you give all the info needed.

*  The restaurant doesn't remember your past orders. It treats each order as if it's the first time.

*  If you want to change your order, you tell the waiter everything about the change. You don't assume they remember your old orders.

Here's an example:

**Non-RESTful (Stateful):**

1. You order a pizza:

   ```json
   {
     "order_id": 1,
     "items": ["pizza"],
     "delivery_address": "123 Main St"
   }
   ```

   - The server remembers your address from this order.

2. For your next order, you only list the new items, assuming they know your address:

   ```json
   {
     "order_id": 2,
     "items": ["sushi"]
   }
   ```

   - Here, you expect the server to remember your address from the previous order.

**RESTful (Stateless):**

1. You order a pizza:

   ```json
   {
     "items": ["pizza"],
     "delivery_address": "123 Main St"
   }
   ```

   - The server treats this as a new order, assigns an order ID, and records your address.

2. For your next order, you provide all the details, including the new address:

   ```json
   {
     "items": ["sushi"],
     "delivery_address": "456 Elm St"
   }
   ```

   - In this stateless approach, you include all the needed info in each order. The server doesn't rely on past orders.

In a stateless RESTful approach, the server doesn't remember your info from earlier. Each request has everything it needs, making it easier to handle orders without relying on server memory.

Advantages and disadvantages of statelessness in RESTful APIs:

**Advantages:**

1. **Simplicity:** Stateless requests are easy to understand and manage because each request is self-contained.

2. **Scalability:** It's easier to scale servers when they don't have to remember past requests, making systems more robust.

3. **Reliability:** There's no risk of servers forgetting important information from previous requests, reducing errors.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Repetition:** You need to include the same details in each request, which can be repetitive and make requests larger.

2. **Complexity for Clients:** Clients must manage all the information for each request, which can be more work for them.

3. **Security:** Without server memory, security tokens or credentials must be included in every request, potentially exposing them to more risks if not handled properly.

So, while statelessness offers simplicity and scalability, it can also lead to more data repetition and complexity for clients.
