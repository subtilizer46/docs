25. What is RESTful routing in Flask?
RESTful routing in Flask is a design pattern that maps HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specific routes and views to create a RESTful API.

26. How do you set up authentication for a REST API in Flask?
Authentication for a REST API in Flask can be implemented using token-based authentication, OAuth2, or other authentication mechanisms.

27. What is Flask-CORS, and why is it used?
Flask-CORS is an extension that allows you to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in your Flask application, making it possible to request resources from a different domain.

28. How do you handle file uploads in Flask?

29. What is the purpose of Flask-RESTful, and how is it used?
Flask-RESTful is an extension that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs in Flask by providing classes for creating resources, handling requests, and defining routes.

30. How do you handle middleware in Flask?
Flask allows you to use middleware functions or decorators to execute code before and after request processing.

31. What is Flask Blueprints, and why are they used?
Flask Blueprints are a way to organize routes and views into separate modules or packages, making it easier to structure large Flask applications.

32. What is the purpose of the `g` object in Flask, and how is it used?
The `g` object in Flask is a global context object that can be used to store and share data during a single request-response cycle.

33. How do you run a Flask application in production?
In production, you typically use a production-ready web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI to serve a Flask application behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache.

34. Explain how to handle database transactions in Flask-SQLAlchemy.
