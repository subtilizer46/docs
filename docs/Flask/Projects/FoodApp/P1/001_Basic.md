* Creating a "FoodApp" web application in Flask. 
* Flask is a micro web framework for Python, and it makes it easy to build web applications. 
* Here's a simple example of a "FoodApp" Flask application:

1. First, make sure you have Flask installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:

```
pip install Flask
```

2. Next, create a Python script (e.g., `app.py`) with the following content:

```python
from flask import Flask

# Create a Flask application instance
app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a route for the "FoodApp" message
@app.route('/')
def food_app():
    return 'Food App'

# Run the application if this script is executed
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this code:

- We import the `Flask` class from the Flask library.
- We create an instance of the Flask application using `app = Flask(__name__)`.
- We define a route using the `@app.route('/')` decorator. In this case, we're defining a route for the root URL `'/'`.
- The `food_app` function is associated with this route, and it simply returns the "Food App" message.
- Finally, we start the Flask application using `app.run()` when the script is executed.

3. Save the `app.py` file.

4. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `app.py` is located.

5. Run the Flask application by executing the following command:

```
python app.py
```

You should see output indicating that the Flask development server is running. By default, it should be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

When you access this URL, you should see the "Food App" message displayed in your browser.
