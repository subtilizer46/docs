4. **Understanding Test Output**:
   
   When you run the `pytest` command, it will search for all the files in the current directory and its sub-directories that match the pattern `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`. It will then execute all the functions within those files that are prefixed with `test_`.

   The output will provide you with a summary of how many tests passed or failed.

   For example, if the test passes:
   ```
   =========================== test session starts ===========================
   platform win32 -- Python 3.9.5, pytest-6.2.4, pluggy-0.13.1
   rootdir: C:\path\to\directory
   collected 1 item                                                            

   test_math_functions.py .                                             [100%]

   ============================ 1 passed in 0.03s ============================
   ```

   If there's a failure, pytest will also provide detailed information about which test failed and why.

5. **Grouping and Marking Tests**:

   With `pytest`, you can group tests and give them labels using the `mark` decorator. For instance, if you have slow-running tests, you can label them as 'slow':

   ```python
   import pytest
   from math_functions import add

   @pytest.mark.slow
   def test_add_large_numbers():
       assert add(10**6, 10**6) == 2 * 10**6
   ```

   To run only the slow tests, you'd use:
   ```bash
   pytest -m slow
   ```

   Conversely, to exclude slow tests, you'd use:
   ```bash
   pytest -k "not slow"
   ```

6. **Using Fixtures**:

   Fixtures are a powerful feature of `pytest` that allow you to set up and tear down code for tests. This is especially useful for setting up database connections, mock objects, or other resources.

   Here's a simple example using a fixture:
   ```python
   import pytest
   from math_functions import add

   @pytest.fixture
   def sample_data():
       return (3, 5)

   def test_add_with_fixture(sample_data):
       a, b = sample_data
       assert add(a, b) == 8
   ```

   The `sample_data` fixture will provide data to any test function that takes it as an argument.

7. **Parametrizing Tests**:

   If you want to run a test function multiple times with different arguments, you can use the `parametrize` decorator:

   ```python
   import pytest
   from math_functions import add

   @pytest.mark.parametrize("a,b,result", [(1, 2, 3), (-1, 1, 0), (-1, -1, -2)])
   def test_add_parametrized(a, b, result):
       assert add(a, b) == result
   ```

   This is useful to reduce repetitive tests and to clearly show which sets of data your function is being tested against.

With these tasks, you will have a solid foundation to write and manage your tests using `pytest`. Remember, testing is a continuous process, and as you add more features or find bugs, you should keep updating and adding to your test suite!
