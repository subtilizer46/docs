## What unit testing?

1. **Definition**: Testing individual parts (units) of code in isolation.
2. **Unit**: The smallest testable part of software (e.g., a function).
3. **Isolation**: Ensuring the unit being tested is separate from the rest.
4. **Purpose**: Check if each unit works correctly on its own.
5. **Automated**: Tests are usually set up to run automatically.
6. **Frameworks**: Tools (like JUnit, PyTest) that help in writing and running tests.
7. **Immediate Feedback**: Quickly shows if a code change caused an issue.
8. **Documentation**: Tests show how the unit should behave.
9. **Safe Refactoring**: Change code confidently, knowing tests will reveal breaks.
10. **Quality**: Helps in building reliable software by catching early bugs.



## Importance of unit testing:

1. **Confidence**: Ensures that the code you wrote works correctly.
2. **Safety Net**: Catches bugs early before they become bigger issues.
3. **Improves Code Quality**: Encourages writing modular and maintainable code.
4. **Documentation**: Provides a clear understanding of how individual units should work.
5. **Refactoring Ease**: Change your code fearlessly, knowing tests will catch breaks.
6. **Faster Feedback**: Quickly know if the recent changes broke existing functionality.
7. **Collaboration**: Helps team members understand and trust each otherâ€™s code.
8. **Cost-Efficient**: Identifying and fixing bugs early is cheaper than fixing after release.
9. **Integration**: Verifies if the units of code will integrate well with others.
10. **Customer Satisfaction**: Reduces the chances of delivering faulty software to users.
