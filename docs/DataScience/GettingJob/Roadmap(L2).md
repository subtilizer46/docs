## DataScience_Syllabus_Roadmap

| Step | Topic to Learn                       | Description | Tips |
|------|--------------------------------------|-------------|------|
| 1    | Fundamentals of Programming          | Start with a language conducive to data analysis like Python or R. Learn the basics of syntax, control structures, data types, and file operations. | Choose one language to begin with and become proficient before learning another. Python is widely recommended for beginners. |
| 2    | Data Handling and Manipulation       | Learn how to import, clean, manipulate, and export data using libraries such as pandas in Python or dplyr in R. | Work with real datasets to understand common data issues and how to handle them. |
| 3    | Statistics and Probability           | Gain a solid grounding in descriptive and inferential statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and statistical significance. | Apply statistical methods to actual data to understand their practical application. |
| 4    | Data Visualization                   | Learn to create meaningful visualizations using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2, or Tableau. | Start by replicating graphs from research papers or articles before designing your own. |
| 5    | Databases and SQL                    | Understand database fundamentals and learn SQL for data querying. | Practice by writing queries to extract and analyze data from SQL databases. |
| 6    | Intro to Machine Learning            | Study the basics of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, and common algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and clustering. | Use scikit-learn (Python) to build simple models and understand the underlying mathematics. |
| 7    | Advanced Machine Learning (Optional) | Delve into more complex algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning concepts. | Only proceed to this step after a solid understanding of the basics. Use TensorFlow or PyTorch for practical experience. |
| 8    | Big Data Technologies (Optional)     | Learn the basics of big data processing frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Spark if interested in handling large-scale data. | Get hands-on experience with datasets that are too large to be processed on a single machine. |
| 9    | Data Science Projects                | Apply your knowledge to complete several data science projects from start to finish. | Projects should cover the full spectrum: data cleaning, analysis, modeling, and interpretation. |
| 10   | Soft Skills and Business Acumen      | Develop storytelling ability to communicate findings, and understand how data science applies to business problems. | Practice presenting your findings to both technical and non-technical audiences. |
