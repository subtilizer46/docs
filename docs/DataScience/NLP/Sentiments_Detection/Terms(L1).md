## 1. Sentiment detection
- Sentiment detection is like figuring out if someone is happy, sad, or angry just by reading what they say or write. It's when a computer looks at words and phrases people use and decides if the feelings behind them are positive, negative, or neutral.

## 2. TextBlob
- TextBlob is a simple tool in Python that works with text. Think of it as a friendly helper for doing a bunch of stuff with words and sentences. It can figure out what part of speech each word is, like whether it's a noun or a verb, and it can also check how positive or negative the text is. It's like a Swiss Army knife for playing with text in a straightforward way.

## 3. Polarity

Polarity in text is a score that tells us how positive or negative the language is. Imagine a line where one end is super happy and the other is really sad. Polarity is like a point on that line showing whether the words lean towards happy, sad, or are kind of in the middle.
