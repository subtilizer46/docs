    * Answer: Represents the difference between predicted and actual values, guiding model optimization.

20. What's a neural network?
    * Answer: A set of algorithms, modeled after the human brain, designed to recognize patterns.

21. Define deep learning.
    * Answer: A subset of machine learning using multi-layered neural networks.

22. What is the difference between R and Python in data science?
    * Answer: Both are popular, but R is more statistics-oriented, while Python offers a broader toolkit for data analysis and ML.

23. What is a data warehouse?
    * Answer: A large, centralized database optimized for query and analysis.

24. Define 'data mining'.
    * Answer: The process of discovering patterns and knowledge from large datasets.

25. What's a time series analysis?
    * Answer: Analyzing time-ordered data points to forecast future values.

26. Explain clustering.
    * Answer: Grouping data points with similar characteristics together.

27. What's the difference between classification and regression?
    * Answer: Classification predicts categories, regression predicts continuous values.

28. What is A/B testing?
    * Answer: Experimental technique comparing two versions to determine which performs better.

29. Describe collaborative filtering.
    * Answer: Recommender system technique based on users' past behaviors.

30. What is an outlier?
    * Answer: A data point significantly different from others in the dataset.

31. Why is data cleaning crucial?
    * Answer: Dirty data can lead to incorrect insights and model errors.

32. What is data wrangling or munging?
    * Answer: The process of transforming and cleaning data to make it usable.

33. Define model validation.
    * Answer: Assessing a model's performance using a separate dataset.

34. What is hyperparameter tuning?
    * Answer: Adjusting the external parameters of a model to improve performance.

35. Describe a linear regression.
    * Answer: Predicts a continuous value based on independent variables, assuming a linear relationship.

36. What's the difference between Type I and Type II errors?
    * Answer: Type I is a false positive, Type II is a false negative.

37. Explain logistic regression.
    * Answer: A classification algorithm estimating the probability of a binary outcome.

38. What's the difference between correlation and causation?
    * Answer: Correlation is when two variables change together, causation implies one causes the other.

39. What is data visualization?
    * Answer: Representing data graphically to identify trends and patterns.

40. Explain ensemble methods.
    * Answer: Combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy.

41. What is dimensionality reduction?
    * Answer: Techniques like PCA that reduce the number of features while preserving information.

42. How do you handle imbalanced datasets?
    * Answer: Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using synthetic data.

43. What is an API?
    * Answer: Application Programming Interface, a set of rules allowing software entities to communicate.

44. What's a pivot table?
    * Answer: A data summarization tool that reorients and aggregates data.

45. Explain k-means clustering.
    * Answer: Partitioning data into k clusters based on feature similarity.

46. What's the difference between a data analyst and a data scientist?
    * Answer: Analysts focus on interpreting existing data, while scientists design experiments, build models, and predict.

47. What are eigenvectors and eigenvalues?
    * Answer: In linear algebra, eigenvectors are directions of axes, while eigenvalues represent magnitude or variance in those directions.

48. What's a support vector machine?
    * Answer: A classification and regression algorithm that finds the hyperplane best separating data.

49. Situational: Your model accuracy is 98% on training data but 55% on test data. Why?
    * Answer: The model is likely overfitting on the training data.

50. Situational: A stakeholder demands a more complex model because they believe it will be more accurate. How do you respond?
    * Answer: Complex models can lead to overfitting; it's essential to balance simplicity and predictive power.
