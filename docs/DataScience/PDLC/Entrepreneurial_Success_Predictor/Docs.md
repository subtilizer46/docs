# Entrepreneurial Success Predictor

This script offers a fun way to predict someone's potential for success as an entrepreneur using arbitrary and whimsical criteria.

```python
def entrepreneurial_success_predictor(creativity, problem_solving, risk_tolerance, social_network):
    """
    Predicts the potential for entrepreneurial success.
    
    Parameters:
    creativity (int): Rated from 1 to 10.
    problem_solving (int): Rated from 1 to 10.
    risk_tolerance (int): Rated from 1 to 10.
    social_network (int): Rated from 1 to 10 indicating the strength of social connections.
    
    Returns:
    str: A playful prediction about entrepreneurial success.
    """
    total_score = creativity + problem_solving + risk_tolerance + social_network
    
    if total_score > 30:
        return "You're destined for the entrepreneurial hall of fame!"
    elif 20 < total_score <= 30:
        return "You have great potential as an entrepreneur. Keep networking!"
    elif 10 < total_score <= 20:
        return "There's promise, but you might need to brush up on some skills."
    else:
        return "Entrepreneurship is an art, and there's always room for growth. Keep learning!"

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Rate yourself from 1 to 10 on the following attributes:")
    creativity_score = int(input("Creativity: "))
    problem_solving_score = int(input("Problem Solving Ability: "))
    risk_tolerance_score = int(input("Risk Tolerance: "))
    social_network_score = int(input("Strength of Social Network: "))
    
    prediction = entrepreneurial_success_predictor(
        creativity_score, problem_solving_score, risk_tolerance_score, social_network_score
    )
    
    print(prediction)
```

## Simple Model for Predicting Entrepreneurial Success

Let's create a hypothetical logistic regression model to "predict" entrepreneurial success based on the whimsical dataset.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Hypothetical dataset for entrepreneurial success
data = [
    {'creativity': 8, 'problem_solving': 9, 'risk_tolerance': 7, 'social_network': 10, 'success': 1},
    {'creativity': 5, 'problem_solving': 5, 'risk_tolerance': 5, 'social_network': 3, 'success': 0},
    # ... more hypothetical examples ...
]

# Convert data to a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Separate features and target variable
X = df.drop('success', axis=1)
y = df['success']

# Initialize and train the Logistic Regression model
entrepreneur_model = LogisticRegression()
entrepreneur_model.fit(X, y)

def predict_entrepreneurial_success(creativity, problem_solving, risk_tolerance, social_network):
    """
    Predicts the potential for entrepreneurial success using a logistic regression model.
    
    Parameters:
    creativity, problem_solving, risk_tolerance, social_network (int): The personal attributes rated from 1 to 10.
    
    Returns:
    str: A prediction about entrepreneurial success.
    """
    person_data = pd.DataFrame([{
        'creativity': creativity,
        'problem_solving': problem_solving,
        'risk_tolerance': risk_tolerance,
        'social_network': social_network
    }])
    prediction = entrepreneur_model.predict(person_data)
    return "High potential for entrepreneurial success!" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Success may be a challenge, but where there's a will, there's a way."

# Example interactive session
if __name__ == "__main__":
    creativity_input = int(input("Rate your creativity (1-10): "))
    problem_solving_input = int(input("Rate your problem-solving ability (1-10): "))
    risk_tolerance_input = int(input("Rate your risk tolerance (1-10): "))
    social_network_input = int(input("Rate the strength of your social network (1-10): "))
    
    success_chance = predict_entrepreneurial_success(
        creativity_input, problem_solving_input, risk_tolerance_input, social_network_input
    )
    
    print(success_chance)
```
