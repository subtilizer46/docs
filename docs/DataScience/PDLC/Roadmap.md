ðŸ‘€ New Developer: How to build Machine learning project?

ðŸ˜€ðŸ’» Manager
## Roadmap to build a machine learning project:

1. **Define the Objective**: 
   - What problem are you trying to solve?
   - What will a successful outcome look like?

2. **Choose a Dataset**:
   - Based on your objective, find a suitable dataset.
   - Ensure the dataset has a relevant license for your use.

3. **Data Exploration & Understanding**:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using tools like Pandas and visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
   - Understand the features, missing values, distributions, and potential correlations.

4. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Convert categorical data into numerical format (one-hot encoding, label encoding).
   - Normalize or standardize data if necessary.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

5. **Model Selection**:
   - Based on your problem (classification, regression, clustering, etc.), choose an appropriate algorithm.
   - Start with simple models. For example, Linear Regression for regression problems or Logistic Regression for classification.

6. **Model Training**:
   - Use libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
   - Train the model on your training dataset.

7. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model on the testing set.
   - Use appropriate metrics. For example, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification or MSE for regression.
   - If performance is unsatisfactory, consider tuning hyperparameters, using a different model, or revisiting data preprocessing steps.

8. **Iterate**:
   - Based on the evaluation, iterate on the model. This can mean:
     - Trying different algorithms.
     - Engineering new features.
     - Collecting more data or improving data quality.

9. **Deployment (Optional)**:
   - If your project has an application (like a web app), consider deploying the model using tools like Flask, Django, or platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.
   
10. **Documentation & Presentation**:
    - Document your steps, methodologies, and results.
    - Present your findings, either through a report, a slide deck, or a demo.

11. **Feedback & Improvement**:
    - Gather feedback on your project, be it from peers, mentors, or online communities.
    - Use this feedback for further iterations and improvements.
