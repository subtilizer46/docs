## Explanation of Menus

1. **New Connection**: This option allows you to create a new connection to a MongoDB database. You can specify the connection details such as the URI, authentication credentials, and more.

2. **Saved Connections**: This menu item lists all the previously saved connections. You can select a saved connection to quickly connect to a MongoDB database without re-entering connection details.

3. **Recents**: The "Recents" section displays a list of recently used MongoDB connections, making it easy to access frequently used databases quickly.

4. **New Connection**:
   - **URI**: This option allows you to create a new connection by specifying the MongoDB connection URI directly. The URI typically contains information about the host, port, and authentication details.

   - **Save**: After configuring a new connection, you can choose to save it for future use. This saves the connection details for easy access in the "Saved Connections" section.

   - **Save & Connect**: This option not only saves the connection details but also immediately connects to the MongoDB database using the specified configuration.

   - **Connect**: After configuring a new connection, you can choose to connect to the MongoDB database without saving the connection details. This is useful for one-time connections or when you don't want to save the connection information.
