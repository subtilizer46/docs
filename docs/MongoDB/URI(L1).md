In MongoDB, a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a MongoDB database server or a specific database on that server. It's often referred to as a connection string or MongoDB connection URI. The URI contains all the information necessary to establish a connection to a MongoDB database, including:

1. **Protocol**: Specifies the protocol used to connect to the database server. MongoDB typically uses the `mongodb://` or `mongodb+srv://` protocol.

2. **Hostname**: Specifies the hostname or IP address of the MongoDB server.

3. **Port**: Specifies the port number on which the MongoDB server is listening. The default MongoDB port is 27017.

4. **Database**: Specifies the default database to connect to. If not provided, the connection will be made to the "test" database by default.

5. **Username and Password**: If authentication is required, the URI can include the username and password for authentication.

6. **Authentication Mechanism**: Specifies the authentication mechanism to be used, such as SCRAM-SHA-1, SCRAM-SHA-256, or others.

7. **Connection Options**: Additional connection options and parameters can be included in the URI, such as connection pool settings, SSL options, and more.

Here's an example of a MongoDB connection URI:

```
mongodb://username:password@hostname:27017/mydatabase
```

**Conclusion**

In this example, "mongodb://" is the protocol, "username" and "password" are the authentication credentials, "hostname" is the address of the MongoDB server, "27017" is the default MongoDB port, and "mydatabase" is the name of the database to connect to.

Using a URI is a convenient way to specify connection details in a single string, making it easier to manage and share database connection configurations in MongoDB applications.
