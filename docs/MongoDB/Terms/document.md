## 1. What is document?

* In MongoDB, a document is a basic unit of data storage and retrieval. 
* It is a JSON-like data structure that consists of key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be various data types, including strings, numbers, arrays, and even nested documents. 
* Documents are used to store and represent data within MongoDB collections, which are analogous to tables in relational databases. 

* In MySQL, data is typically organized into tables with rows and columns, following a relational data model. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a field or attribute.

* In MongoDB, data is organized into collections of documents. Each document is like a record and can have a flexible structure, allowing for different fields in each document. The data in MongoDB is stored in a semi-structured format, often resembling JSON.

Here's a comparison:

MySQL:
- Uses tables with fixed schemas.
- Data is organized into rows and columns.
- Tables typically have predefined structures.
- Relational database with support for complex queries and transactions.

MongoDB:
- Uses collections of documents.
- Documents have flexible, schema-less structures.
- Documents can have varying fields.
- NoSQL database, designed for scalability and flexibility, suitable for semi-structured or unstructured data.


**In Simple**
- In MongoDB, a "document" is conceptually similar to a "row" in a relational database like MySQL
