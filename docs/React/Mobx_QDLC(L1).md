## Mobx with ReactJS:

1. What is Mobx, and how does it relate to ReactJS?

Mobx is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It is used to manage the application's state in a more efficient way. It can be integrated into React applications to handle state management fluently.

2. What problem does Mobx solve in React applications?

Mobx simplifies state management in React applications by providing a way to make the state observable and automatically update components when the state changes. This solves the problem of manually managing and syncing state across various components.

3. Explain the core concepts of Mobx.

Mobx revolves around three core concepts: Observables (representing state), Computed values (derived from observables), and Actions (functions that modify observables).

4. How do you install Mobx in a React project?

You can install Mobx and its React bindings with npm or yarn:
npm install mobx mobx-react

5. What is an observable in Mobx, and why is it important?

An observable is a value that can be tracked for changes. It's important in Mobx because it forms the basis of reactivity. When an observable changes, any dependent reactions (like React components) are automatically updated.

6. What are computed properties in Mobx, and how are they different from observables?

Computed properties are derived values based on observables. They are not directly modified but automatically updated when their dependencies (observables) change.

7. How do you define an observable in Mobx?

You can define an observable using the observable keyword or the @observable decorator in class-based components.

8. What is the purpose of the @observable decorator?

The @observable decorator is used to mark class properties as observables, making them reactive.

9. How can you use Mobx to manage the state of a React component?

You can create a Mobx store or use observables within a component to manage its state. Then, you can use the @observer decorator to make the component reactive.

10. What is Mobx's approach to managing mutable state?

Mobx allows you to directly mutate state, but it ensures that any observer (like React components) gets notified and updates accordingly.

11. Explain the concept of actions in Mobx.

Actions are functions used to modify state (observables). They ensure that changes are tracked and that observers are notified.

12. How do you define an action in Mobx?

You can define an action using the @action decorator in class-based components or by using runInAction to group multiple changes into a single action.

13. What is Mobx's reaction concept, and why is it useful?

Reactions are functions that automatically run when observables they depend on change. They are useful for handling side effects or updating non-observable data.

14. How does Mobx ensure that React components automatically re-render when state changes?

Mobx uses the @observer decorator to wrap React components. This decorator makes components observe the state, so they re-render automatically when the state changes.

15. What is the Mobx Provider, and why is it important in React applications?

The Mobx Provider is part of the Mobx-React library. It provides the Mobx store to components within its context, making it accessible to all child components. This is important for sharing state across the application.

16. How can you use the @observer decorator in Mobx with React components?

You can use the @observer decorator by wrapping your class-based React component with it. This decorator makes the component reactive.

17. What is the purpose of Mobx's autorun function?

autorun is a Mobx function that automatically runs a function whenever any observable it depends on changes. It's often used for side effects like logging or network requests.

18. Explain the role of Mobx's reaction function.

reaction is used to create a function that observes specific observables and runs another function when a condition is met. It's useful for reacting to specific changes in the state.

19. How does Mobx handle asynchronous actions and side effects?

Mobx provides tools like async actions and flow for managing asynchronous actions and side effects while ensuring reactivity.

20. What are Mobx's strict mode and non-strict mode, and how do they differ?

Mobx has a strict mode that enforces a set of rules for safe state management. Non-strict mode relaxes some of these rules for advanced use cases.

21. How can you organize your Mobx store(s) in a larger React application?

You can organize Mobx stores by domain or feature, creating separate stores for different parts of your application. This helps maintain a clear structure and separation of concerns.

22. What is the purpose of the Mobx DevTools extension, and how can it be helpful during development?

Mobx DevTools is a browser extension that helps developers visualize and inspect the Mobx state tree and track changes. It's immensely helpful for debugging and understanding state changes.

23. What are some common debugging techniques for Mobx-related issues in a React application?

Common debugging techniques include using Mobx DevTools, logging, and examining the Mobx state tree. You can also check for circular dependencies or incorrect usage of actions.

24. How can you achieve fine-grained control over when a component re-renders in Mobx?

Mobx provides shouldComponentUpdate and react options to control when a component should re-render based on specific conditions or observables.

25. Explain the concept of Mobx's "transaction" in the context of state updates.

A Mobx transaction allows you to group multiple state changes into a single transaction, ensuring that observers are notified only once, improving performance.

26. What are Mobx actions' best practices for optimizing React component updates?

Best practices include grouping related changes into a single action, using runInAction for complex updates, and using fine-grained observables for more granular control over reactivity.

27. How can you share state between React components using Mobx?

You can create a Mobx store to hold shared state and inject it into components using the Mobx Provider or the useStore hook.

28. What is the Mobx when function, and how can it be used to react to specific conditions?

The when function in Mobx allows you to react to specific conditions or events by providing a predicate function that triggers when the condition becomes true.

29. How does Mobx compare to other state management solutions, like Redux, in the context of React applications?

Mobx offers a more flexible and reactive approach to state management compared to Redux, which is more structured. Mobx can simplify state management but may require careful design to maintain organization in larger applications.

30. What are some potential performance considerations when using Mobx with a large-scale React application?

Performance considerations include optimizing observables, using the right data structures, and minimizing unnecessary re-renders by controlling reactions and updates carefully. Mobx DevTools can help identify performance bottlenecks.
