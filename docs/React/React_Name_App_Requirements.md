    - Removal can be done individually or for multiple names at once.

3. **Clear the Data:**
    - Users should be able to clear all the names from the list with a "Clear Data" feature.
    - This action should ask for confirmation to prevent accidental data loss.

4. **Sort:**
    - Users should be able to sort the list of names in ascending or descending order.
    - A sorting option should be provided, such as "Sort A-Z" and "Sort Z-A."

5. **Display Count of the Number:**
    - The application should display the total count of names in the list.
    - This count should dynamically update as names are added or removed.

6. **Search:**
