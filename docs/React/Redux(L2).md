## Explanation:


## 001_Step

```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';
```

This line imports the `createStore` function from the Redux library. The `createStore` function is used to create a Redux store object.

## 002_Step

```javascript
const initialState = {
  count: 0,
};
```

This line defines the initial state of the Redux store. The initial state is a plain JavaScript object that represents the current state of the application.


## 003_Step:

```javascript
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return {
        ...state,
        count: state.count + 1,
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

This line defines the reducer function. The reducer function is a pure function that takes the current state of the application and an action object as input and returns the new state of the application.


## 004_Step:

```javascript
const store = createStore(reducer);
```

This line creates a new Redux store object using the `createStore` function and the reducer function that we defined previously.

## 005_Step :

```javascript
export default store;
```

This line exports the Redux store object so that it can be used in other parts of the application.


**Summary till 005_Step**

1. We import the `createStore` function from the Redux library.
2. We define the initial state of the Redux store.
3. We define the reducer function.
4. We create a new Redux store object using the `createStore` function and the reducer function.
5. We export the Redux store object so that it can be used in other parts of the application.


## 006_Step :

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
```

These two lines import the `React` library and the `connect` function from the `react-redux` library. The `connect` function is used to connect a React component to a Redux store.


## 007_Step :


```javascript
const Counter = ({ count, dispatch }) => {
```

This line defines a React component called `Counter`. This component takes two props: `count` and `dispatch`. The `count` prop is the current value of the count state in the Redux store. The `dispatch` function is used to dispatch actions to the Redux store.


## 008_Step :

```javascript
  const handleClick = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
  };
```

This line defines a function called `handleClick`. This function is called when the user clicks the "Increment" button. The `dispatch` function is used to dispatch an `INCREMENT` action to the Redux store.

## 009_Step :


```javascript
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This line returns the JSX for the `Counter` component. The component displays the current count value and a button that the user can click to increment the count.

## 010_Step :



```javascript
const mapStateToProps = state => ({
  count: state.count,
});
```

This line defines a function called `mapStateToProps`. This function takes the Redux store state as input and returns an object that contains the props that will be passed to the `Counter` component. In this case, we are only passing the `count` prop.

## 011_Step :



```javascript
export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Counter);
```

This line exports the `Counter` component, but it also wraps it in the `connect` function. This connects the `Counter` component to the Redux store and it also passes the `count` prop to the component from the Redux store.


**Summary till 011_Steps**

1. We import the `React` library and the `connect` function from the `react-redux` library.
2. We define a React component called `Counter`.
3. We define a function called `handleClick` which is used to dispatch an `INCREMENT` action to the Redux store.
4. We return the JSX for the `Counter` component.
5. We define a function called `mapStateToProps` which takes the Redux store state as input and returns an object that contains the props that will be passed to the `Counter` component.
6. We export the `Counter` component, but we also wrap it in the `connect` function. This connects the `Counter` component to the Redux store and it also passes the `count` prop to the component from the Redux store.


## 012_Step :


```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';
import Counter from './components/Counter';
```

These lines import the `React` library, the `Provider` component from the `react-redux` library, the Redux store from the `store` file, and the `Counter` component from the `components/Counter` file.

```javascript
const App = () => {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Counter />
    </Provider>
  );
};
```

This function defines the `App` component. This is the root component of the application. The `Provider` component wraps the `Counter` component and makes the Redux store available to it.

## 013_Step :


```javascript
export default App;
```


This line exports the `App` component so that it can be rendered in the application.

**Summary till 013_Steps**

1. We import the `React` library, the `Provider` component from the `react-redux` library, the Redux store from the `store` file, and the `Counter` component from the `components/Counter` file.
2. We define the `App` component. This is the root component of the application.
3. We wrap the `Counter` component in the `Provider` component. This makes the Redux store available to the `Counter` component.
4. We export the `App` component so that it can be rendered in the application.

When we render the `App` component, the `Provider` component will make the Redux store available to all of its child components, including the `Counter` component. The `Counter` component can then use the Redux store to get the current count value and dispatch actions to update the store.
