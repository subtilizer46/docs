The `useEffect` hook is used for handling side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, and subscribing to external data sources.

73. What is the difference between `useEffect` and `componentDidMount` in class components?
`componentDidMount` is a lifecycle method in class components that is called after the component is rendered, while `useEffect` is a hook used in functional components to achieve the same effect.

74. How do you pass data from a child component to a parent component in React?
You can pass data from a child component to a parent component by defining a callback function in the parent and passing it to the child as a prop. The child can then call this callback function to send data to the parent.

75. What is the purpose of the `key` prop when rendering a list of elements in React?
The `key` prop is used to uniquely identify elements in a list, enabling React to efficiently update, reorder, or remove elements when the list changes.

76. What is the significance of React DevTools?
React DevTools is a browser extension that provides a set of tools for inspecting and debugging React applications. It helps developers visualize component hierarchies, state changes, and props.

77. What is the purpose of the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop in React?
The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop is used to insert HTML content into a React component. It should be used with caution, as it can expose applications to security risks if not used properly.

78. How can you optimize

 the performance of a React application?
You can optimize a React application's performance by minimizing unnecessary renders, using memoization, implementing lazy loading, and code splitting, and optimizing network requests.

79. Explain the concept of code splitting in React.
Code splitting is a technique used to split a large JavaScript bundle into smaller, more manageable chunks that can be loaded on-demand. This can improve the initial loading time of an application.

80. What is the purpose of the `shouldComponentUpdate` method in React class components?
The `shouldComponentUpdate` method allows you to control whether a component should re-render when its state or props change. It can be used to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary renders.

81. How does React handle routing in single-page applications (SPAs)?
React can handle routing in SPAs by using libraries like React Router. It allows developers to define routes and map them to different components, enabling navigation without full page reloads.

82. What are the differences between `useMemo` and `useCallback` in React?
`useMemo` is used to memoize a computed value, while `useCallback` is used to memoize a function. Both help in optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary calculations or re-renders.

83. Explain the concept of prop drilling in React.
Prop drilling occurs when you pass props through multiple levels of nested components, making it less efficient and harder to maintain. Context or state management solutions can help alleviate this issue.

84. What is the purpose of the `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method in React class components?
The `componentDidUpdate` method is called after a component has been updated, allowing you to perform side effects based on changes in state or props.

Memoization is an optimization technique used to cache the results of expensive computations and reuse them when the same computation is requested again. In React, it can be achieved using hooks like `useMemo` or `useCallback`.

88. What is the role of keys in React when rendering dynamic lists?
Keys are used to give React a way to differentiate between elements in a dynamic list, helping it efficiently update and re-render only the changed elements.

React supports server-side rendering by rendering components on the server and sending HTML to the client, which improves performance and SEO.

94. What is the purpose of the `useLayoutEffect` hook in React?
The `useLayoutEffect` hook is similar to `useEffect` but is synchronous and runs immediately after the DOM is updated. It is often used for DOM measurements or animations.

95. Explain the concept of code splitting in React.
Code splitting is a technique used to split a large JavaScript bundle into smaller, more manageable chunks that can be loaded on-demand. This can improve the initial loading time of an application.
