## What is Redux?

Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It provides a predictable way to manage the state of your application, and makes it easy to share state between components.

# Basic principles of Redux.

**Basic Redux terminologies:**

* **Action:** An action is an object that describes what happened in the application. It has a type property, which is a string that identifies the action, and an optional payload property, which can contain additional information about the action.
* **Reducer:** A reducer is a function that takes an action and the current state of the application, and returns a new state. Reducers are pure functions, which means that they must always return the same output for the same input.
* **Store:** The store is an object that holds the current state of the application. There should only be one store in a Redux application.
* **Dispatcher:** The dispatcher is a function that dispatches actions to the store. When an action is dispatched, the store will call the reducers to update the state.

**How Redux works:**

When something happens in the application, such as a user clicking a button, the application dispatches an action. The dispatcher then sends the action to the store. The store will then call the reducers to update the state. Once the state has been updated, the store will notify the components that the state has changed. The components will then re-render based on the new state.

**Benefits of using Redux:**

* **Predictable state:** Redux's one-way data flow makes the state of your application predictable. This makes it easier to debug and test your application.
* **Shared state:** Redux makes it easy to share state between components. This can simplify your application code and make it more reusable.
* **Performance:** Redux is a very performant state management library. It is well-suited for large and complex applications.

Here is a example of how to use Redux:

```javascript
// Define an action type.
const INCREMENT_COUNTER = 'INCREMENT_COUNTER';

// Create a reducer.
function counterReducer(state = 0, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT_COUNTER:
      return state + 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

// Create a store.
const store = createStore(counterReducer);

// Dispatch an action to increment the counter.
store.dispatch({ type: INCREMENT_COUNTER });

// Get the current state of the counter.
const counter = store.getState();

// Render the counter.
console.log(counter); // 1
```

**Conclusion**

Redux is a powerful state management library that can help you to write better and more maintainable JavaScript applications. If you are building a complex application, I recommend checking out Redux.
