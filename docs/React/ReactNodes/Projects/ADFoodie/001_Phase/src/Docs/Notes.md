1. **Open your terminal or command prompt**: Navigate to the directory where you want your project to be located.

2. **Create the React App**:
   Use the `npx` command to install the `create-react-app` starter kit globally and create your new project:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app adfoodie
   ```

   This command downloads and installs the necessary dependencies and creates a new React project named `ADFoodie` in a folder called `adfoodie`.

3. **Navigate to your project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd adfoodie
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

5. **Build your application**:
   Now that you have a React skeleton, you can start building your `ADFoodie` application. For instance, you can begin by editing `src/App.js` to add new components, styling, and functionality.

6. **Install Additional Dependencies** (if necessary):
   Depending on your project's needs, you may require additional libraries, such as React Router for navigation or Axios for HTTP requests.

   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom axios
   ```
