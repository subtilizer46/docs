**Why App?**

* let's use an example of an e-commerce website to explain how apps work in Django.
* Imagine you're building an online store like Amazon or eBay. 
* In Django, you would typically structure your project like this:

1. **Django Project**: This is like the overall blueprint for your website, sort of like the entire shopping mall where your online store will exist.

2. **Apps**: Now, within your project, you would create different apps to handle specific functions of your e-commerce site. Here are a few examples:

   - **Product Catalog App**: This app is responsible for managing all the products you sell. It handles things like listing products, displaying product details, and managing product categories.

   - **User Account App**: This app manages user accounts, user registration, login, and profiles. It ensures customers can create and manage their accounts.

   - **Shopping Cart App**: This app deals with the shopping cart functionality. It lets users add products to their cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.

   - **Order Processing App**: This app is in charge of order processing, including taking payment, calculating taxes and shipping costs, and confirming orders.

   - **Review and Rating App**: If you want customers to review and rate products, you'd have an app specifically for that functionality.

   - **Admin Panel App**: Django provides a built-in admin panel, but you can customize it using an app to manage your product catalog, user accounts, and orders easily.
