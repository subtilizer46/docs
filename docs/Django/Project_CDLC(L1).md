* Creating your first Django project involves several steps, including setting up a virtual environment, installing Django, creating a project, and starting the development server. 

* Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Install a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice, such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**:
   It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your Django project's dependencies. Navigate to your project's desired location in the terminal and run:

   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:
   
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Django**:
   While inside the virtual environment, install Django using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install Django
   ```

4. **Create a Django Project**:
   Create a Django project by running the following command:

   ```bash
   django-admin startproject myproject
   ```

   Replace "myproject" with the desired name for your project.

5. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Go to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd myproject
   ```


6. **Start the Development Server**:
   Start the Django development server to see your project in action:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The development server will start, and you'll see output indicating the server is running. By default, it will run at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
