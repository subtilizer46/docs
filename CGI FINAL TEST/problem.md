​
## Objective
​
- In this case study, you have to create a simple Flask API web application where you should be able to add customer,view all customers. 
​
- Create API gateway and access the REST APIs through it.  
​
- The APIs ( access through gateway ) should be tested through Postman. Screenshot should be captured and shared. 
​
- Dockerize all the services ( creation of Dockerfile and Docker-compose). Share the screenshot showing the services are up and running ( use docker ps command)
​

​
			- customerId : int
			- customerName : String

                - code : 200 for successful
​
- Create API gateway and access the above REST APIs through that
​
- Dockerize the above services
​
MUST DO:
​
- Test the REST APIs using postman and share the screenshots of them
- Share the screenshot showing the containers are running
